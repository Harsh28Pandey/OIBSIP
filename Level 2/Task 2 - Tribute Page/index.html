            <h2>Why I Admire Him</h2>
            <p>
                Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was an inspiring figure whose life teaches humility, perseverance, and dedication
                to the nation.
                He rose from humble beginnings to become India's 11th President and a legendary aerospace scientist.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I adore most is his unshakable commitment to education and his message to the youth to dream big.
                He continues to ignite minds even after his passing through his books, speeches, and life values.
            </p>
            <p>
                He once said, <strong>"Dream is not that which you see while sleeping, it is something that does not let
                    you sleep."</strong>
